# RGB565

These 8x32 matrix displays aren't true color, so we don't need 24 bits for each pixel. A common way to save flash space is, the RGB565 format. Instead of 8 bit per color you  use 5 bit for red and blue and 6 for green. The result is visually the same but you need only 66% of flash space.

So this branch uses RGB56 and increased the amount of icons and the maximum number of frames per animation.

There is a open pull request in esphome until the release you have to use my repos to use this nice feature.

E.g.

```
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/lubeda/EsphoMaTrix
      ref: rgb565
    refresh: 60s 
    components: [ ehmtx ]   
```
